                <h2>A very good day to <b>You</b> my friend :)</h2>
                <p>Firstly, a big welcome to the Heirloam family. We are a group of individuals who believe in the power of the individual, as a singular person, we can be anything we believe in. As a group, we can be mighty morphin' power rangers, yet with great powers, comes great responsibility. As such, we must use our powers for good.</p>
				<p>At Heirloam, we strive to be good, learning from the past, pushing boundaries in the present, and leaving legacies for the future. Everyone has the power of life, we are the masters of our land, let us each grow our favourite fruit or vegetable, and share our learnings with each other. At the end of it all, we get to eat and migrate with our favourite harvests, and more importantly share with everyone what the Earth truly has for every single sentient being</p>
				<p>Sincerely hope you enjoy your stay here in this family, I am a Technical developer from Singapore who believes in the strength of the human race, with the conviction that we, as masters of our land, must be good masters, and take care of all life, to manage the bountiful resources that has been endowed to us in our environment and to share it for greater good.</p>
				<p></p>
				<p>Cheers to a world of happy beings! Let us make aliens jealous of what we create!</p>
				
				<br>
				<br>
				<p>With love,</p>
